            <div class="half-width">

              <p>I've made my home base in San Francisco, CA, with my small family. My journey into tech started with a Codecademy course. As I finished some fo the basics there, I was excited to keep learning more. Skillcrush was a game changer for me. I am currently a student in their extensive Break Into Tech course! This website will be updated with my progress. This static website was my first project that I built, using what I learned about HTML and CSS.</p>

            <div class="half-width">
              <p>I'm currently work for Future Bars Inc. I started in the prep kitchen and worked my way up, eventually creating my own job running the Cask Stores ecommerce site, newsletter, and social media marketing. </p>
